# Factor-Retirement-SPSS

This practice uses the ELSA Wave 7 dataset which was collected between 2014 and 2015 among people who live in the UK and are aged 50+, The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) seeks to produce data that are equally pertinent to understanding the determinants of social exclusion or economic disadvantage as they are to understand the causes of disease or disability at older ages.

# Factor Analysis of Retirement Using SPSS

## Overview
This project utilizes data from the **ELSA Wave 7 dataset (2014-2015)**, which surveys individuals **aged 50+ living in the UK**. The **English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)** provides critical insights into the determinants of **social exclusion, economic disadvantage, health, and ageing-related issues**. 

The analysis focuses on **retirement factors** using **SPSS** to uncover key trends and relationships affecting older adults' financial and social well-being.
